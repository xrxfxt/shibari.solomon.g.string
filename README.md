# [The Solomon G-String - TheDuchy](img/solomon-g-string)

These could also be used as a kind of rope chastity belt or method to tease
your partner. The name comes from the key feature, called the “Solomon Bar”,
something created by repeating a [Cored Square Knot](https://www.theduchy.com/cored-square-knot/)

## Creating the Solomon G-String

[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-1.jpg) 1. Begin with a 15’ (5 m) piece of rope, folded in half. _I highly recommend you use synthetic fiber for this application as it can be washed afterwards (although not entirely sanitized)._
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-2.jpg) 2. Determine how long you want the Solomon bar to be. (Presumably enough to cover a portion of the crotch…)
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-3.jpg) 3. Find something about 2 inches wide to act as a spacer and place it above that point. (I just use a piece of cardboard.)
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-4.jpg) 4. Fold the tails over top of that object.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-5.jpg) 5. Begin creating a Cored Square Knot.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-6.jpg) 6. Continue creating Cored Square Knots to create the Solomon Bar.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-7.jpg) 7. When you’re almost out of space, lock off the Solomon Bar. Note that this line is coming up out of the Solomon Bar, toward the camera…
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-8.jpg) 8. … It should therefore come up through this hole.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-9.jpg) 9. This line is going down, away from the camera…
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-10.jpg) 10. … It should therefore go down to this hole.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-11.jpg) 11. First one side.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-12.jpg) 12. Then the other.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-13.jpg) 13. It should look like this.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-14.jpg) 14. Remove the spacer.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-15.jpg) 15. If this point seems too loose to you and you have used slippery rope like nylon or MFP, you can tighten it.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-16.jpg) 16. To do so, grip the Solomon Bar…
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-17.jpg) 17. …then grip the middle lines of the core and pull them away from the Solomon Bar.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Creating-18.jpg) 18. Work the bar a bit and that endpoint will tighten.

## Applying the Solomon G-String

[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-1.jpg) 1. Place the completed G-String with a loop to the front. _Health and safety note: Putting rope between someone’s legs will mean that that rope will become impregnated with whatever happens to be going on down there. You can protect your rope with plastic wrap or other barrier methods, or … Perhaps that’s not the point of this particular tie … you do you. That said, if you do use the rope without protecting it, that rope needs to become dedicated only to you and any fluid bonded partners. You can never fully sanitize rope._
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-2.jpg) 2. Run the tail to the back and create an Overhand Knot just above the butt cheeks.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-3.jpg) 3. Separate the tails and run them over the hips to the front.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-4.jpg) 4. Run the tails through the loops in the front and reverse tension.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-5.jpg) 5. Run the tails tour the back again. Make sure they run parallel to the first lines with no twists.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-6.jpg) 6. Bring both lines through between the strands of the stem in the back, below the knot.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-7.jpg) 7. If you still have rope leftover, repeat. Bring the lines to the front.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-8.jpg) 8. Run them through the loops and reverse tension.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-9.jpg) 9. Bring them to the back.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-10.jpg) 10. Run them under some of the ropes here.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-11.jpg) 11. Lock off however you wish (not shown). _Perhaps wrapping the remaining rope around the waist band, or adding bunting with Half Hitches or Cow Hitches, etc_
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-12.jpg) 12. Done!
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-13.jpg) 13. (A slightly different angle.)
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-14.jpg) 14. To answer the specific question of the person reached out to me: Once these have been worn, you can take them off and use this Solomon Bar as a Cleave Gag.
[](img/Solomon-G-String-Applied-15.jpg) 15. Place the Solomon Bar into the mouth and then run the tails around the back of the head and through the loops and tie off however wish! _Important: Coming into contact with bodily fluids and other material includes risk of transmitting infections and other issues. As always, negotiate and discuss health and risk before all activities_.
